It started as an ordinary afternoon. I was heading to the grocery store to pick up necessities when something caught my eye - a new thrift shop had opened nearby. Its sign was old and faded, hanging by a single chain, and the shop itself looked strangely out of place, as though it didn’t belong in the neighborhood.
Curiosity got the better of me, so I stepped inside. The air was oddly cold, and the faint scent of mildew hung in the air. Racks of second-hand clothes filled the dimly lit space, and I began browsing, though none of the clothes particularly stood out - until I saw it.
A white, elegant dress hung at the far end of the store, standing out like a beacon among the worn-out garments. It was pristine, too clean to be here, and adorned with a single red rose stitched delicately onto the right shoulder. The design was breathtaking - modern yet timeless - and I was drawn to it immediately.
I asked the shop owner, a hunched old man with an unsettling grin, how much it cost. He waved me off.
"No one will buy it," he muttered. "Take it. It’s yours."
It seemed too good to be true, but I didn’t question it. Free was free, after all. I thanked him and left, feeling oddly triumphant as I continued to the grocery store.
When I got home, I couldn’t wait to try it on. The dress fit perfectly, hugging my figure as though it were made just for me. I felt beautiful. My mother, however, wasn’t as thrilled.
"Where did you get that dress?" she asked, her tone sharp.
I told her about the thrift store and how I got it for free. Her face darkened.
"You should never bring things like that home," she said. "You don’t know where they came from. Sometimes, clothes carry the spirits of their owners, especially if the owner is… no longer alive."
I rolled my eyes. "That’s just a superstition, Mom. It’s just a dress."
Still, her words left a faint unease in my mind.
A few days later, I wore the dress to a friend’s birthday party. I received compliments, but something felt off the entire night. The air around me seemed heavier, and I kept hearing faint whispers, though no one was near me. I chalked it up to my imagination - or maybe hunger - and tried to ignore it.
When my friends invited me to drink, I declined and decided to walk home since it wasn’t far. The streets were eerily quiet, lit only by flickering streetlights. Dogs barked aggressively in the distance, though no one else was around.
I felt it before I heard it - someone was following me. My heartbeat quickened as I quickened my pace, but the footsteps behind me grew louder, faster. Panic set in, and I turned sharply down a different street, hoping to lose whoever - or whatever - was behind me.
The footsteps stopped. Relieved, I made my way back to the main road, but just as I turned the corner, I bumped into a young girl.
She was pale, her white dress dirty and tattered. Her eyes locked onto mine, and her voice was eerily calm as she said, "Why are you wearing my sister’s dress?"
I froze.
"This dress," she continued, "is what my sister wore the night our house burned down. They never found her body. You should return it."
Before I could respond, she turned and walked away, vanishing into the shadows. My hands trembled as I touched the fabric of the dress. Could it be possible?
I ran home and told my mother everything. She paled as I spoke, urging me to throw the dress away. I did as she said, tossing it into the garbage bin. But that night, I couldn’t sleep.
The room felt wrong. Heavy. Cold.
When I opened my eyes, I saw nothing - but I felt someone watching me. My dog barked furiously outside, and as I passed the mirror on my way to check on him, I froze.
In the reflection, I was wearing the dress. The same dress I had thrown away.
And behind me, a pale figure stood, her face obscured but her hand reaching for me.
I screamed and ran to my mother, sobbing as I told her what I had seen. She didn’t hesitate. Grabbing lighter fluid, she dragged me outside with the dress and set it ablaze.
As the flames consumed it, I thought I saw a figure in the smoke, watching us before vanishing into the night.
Since then, I’ve never set foot in a thrift store again.
