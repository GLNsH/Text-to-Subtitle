Alright, so... imagine this. You're walking down the street, right? Minding your own business, scrolling through your phone, probably watching some cat video or a guy flipping pancakes in slow motion. And then-bam! Out of nowhere-a pigeon lands in front of you. But this isn't just any pigeon. This pigeon is wearing a tiny hat. Now, you're thinking, "Okay, weird, but kind of cute." But as you step closer, the pigeon stares you down.

just straight-up says, "You're late." Late for what? Who knows? But before you can ask, it flies away. So now you're chasing this pigeon down the street like a maniac, yelling, "What am I late for?!" People are staring, someone's recording you-probably for TikTok-but you don't care because this hat-wearing, talking pigeon clearly knows something you don't. You follow it all the way to a park, and it lands on this bench next to an old man feeding ducks. You're out of breath, you're confused, and

you're still yelling, "What am I late for?" And the old man looks at you and says, "Finally. You're here." And that's when you wake up. Turns out, you've been dreaming this entire time. Except... when you look at your nightstand, there's a tiny pigeon hat just sitting there. Beat. Anyway, that's why I don't drink energy drinks after 10 PM.
