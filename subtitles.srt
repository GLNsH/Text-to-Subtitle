1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,550
Alright, so...

2
00:00:01,551 --> 00:00:02,785
 imagine this. 

3
00:00:02,786 --> 00:00:12,750
You're walking down the street, right? Minding your own  business, scrolling through your phone, probably watching some cat video or  a  guy flipping pancakes in slow motion. 

4
00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:15,785
And then-bam! Out of  nowhere-a pigeon lands in front of  you. 

5
00:00:15,786 --> 00:00:17,605
But this isn't just any  pigeon. 

6
00:00:17,606 --> 00:00:19,650
This pigeon is wearing a  tiny hat.


7
00:00:19,651 --> 00:00:24,575
Now, you're thinking, "Okay, weird, but kind of  cute."

8
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:28,340
 But as  you step closer, the pigeon stares you down. 

9
00:00:28,341 --> 00:00:31,320
Like, full-on eye contact. 

10
00:00:31,321 --> 00:00:32,780
And then-it speaks. 

11
00:00:32,781 --> 00:00:36,885
Yeah, the pigeon just straight-up says, "You're late."

12
00:00:36,886 --> 00:00:40,965
 Late for what? Who knows? But before you can ask,, it flies awayy.


13
00:00:40,966 --> 00:00:55,370
So now you're chasing this pigeon down the street like a  maniac, yelling, "What am  I late for?!" People are  staring, someone's recording you-probably for TikTok-but you don't care because this hat-wearing, talking pigeon clearly knows something you don't.


14
00:00:55,371 --> 00:00:59,895
You follow it all  the way to a  park, and  it lands on  this bench next to an  old  man feeding ducks. 

15
00:00:59,896 --> 00:01:07,930
You're out  of  breath, you're confused, and  you're still yelling, "What am  I late for?" And the old  man looks at  you and  says, "Finally. 

16
00:01:07,931 --> 00:01:09,075
You're here."

17
00:01:09,076 --> 00:01:10,940
And that's when you wake up. 

18
00:01:10,941 --> 00:01:13,570
Turns out,, you've been dreaming this entire time. 

19
00:01:13,571 --> 00:01:14,440
Except...

20
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:18,875
 when you look at  your nightstand, there's a  tiny pigeon hat just sitting there.


21
00:01:18,876 --> 00:01:19,705
Beat.


22
00:01:19,706 --> 00:01:23,240
Anyway, that's why I don't drink energy drinks afteer 10 PM.
